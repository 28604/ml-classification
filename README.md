# ml-classification
Binary and multi-class classification algorithm using linear models coded from scratch.

### Problem: classify MNIST dataset using binary classification (odd / even) and multi-class classification (0-9)

### Description
The training dataset contains 10,000 images (28x28 grayscale) with 1,000 samples per digit. You should create feature vectors based on the input coordinates as the modelâ€™s inputs and train your binary classification and multi-class classification model to classify the training data. Predict the class for the 2,000 images in the testing dataset and save your predictions as a .csv file. For each approach, the **accuray of your predictions on the testing dataset must be more than 85%**; otherwise, you will fail the correctness check.

### Grading policy
If the testing accuracy of your prediction is greater than 85%, you will receive full credits.

### Classification method
* Binary Classification
  
* Multi-class Classification


### Other Details
* K-fold cross validation

### Challenge
* Find the best basis function to make the features as linearly separable as possible
